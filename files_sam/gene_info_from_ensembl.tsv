Gene	ADY2	core	sgd	YCR010C_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Acetate transporter required for normal sporulation; phosphorylated in mitochondria; ADY2 has a paralog, ATO2, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000603]	R64-1-1	133124	132273	III	-1	YCR010C
Gene		core	sgd	YBR300C_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Dubious open reading frame; unlikely to encode a functional protein, based on available experimental and comparative sequence data; partially overlaps the verified gene YBR301W; YBR300C is not an essential gene [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000504]	R64-1-1	809097	808600	II	-1	YBR300C
Gene		core	sgd	YKL030W_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Dubious open reading frame; unlikely to encode a functional protein, based on available experimental and comparative sequence data; not conserved in closely related Saccharomyces species; partially overlaps the verified gene MAE1 [Source:SGD;Acc:S000001513]	R64-1-1	383103	382498	XI	1	YKL030W
Gene	FIT1	core	sgd	YDR534C_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Mannoprotein that is incorporated into the cell wall; incorporated via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor; involved in the retention of siderophore-iron in the cell wall [Source:SGD;Acc:S000002942]	R64-1-1	1504900	1503314	IV	-1	YDR534C
Gene		core	sgd	YBR219C_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Putative protein of unknown function; YBR219C is not an essential gene [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000423]	R64-1-1	663303	662499	II	-1	YBR219C
Gene	BUD27	core	sgd	YFL023W_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Unconventional prefoldin protein involved in translation initiation; required for correct assembly of RNAP I, II, and III in an Rpb5p-dependent manner; shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm; mutants have inappropriate expression of nutrient sensitive genes due to translational derepression of Gcn4p transcription factor; diploid mutants show random budding; ortholog of human URI/RMP [Source:SGD;Acc:S000001871]	R64-1-1	93376	90986	VI	1	YFL023W
Gene		core	sgd	YHR213W-B_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Pseudogenic fragment with similarity to flocculins; identified by gene-trapping, microarray-based expression analysis, and genome-wide homology searching; YHR213W-B has a paralog, YAR064W, that arose from a segmental duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000028652]	R64-1-1	541099	540800	VIII	1	YHR213W-B
Gene		core	sgd	YMR245W_mRNA.	sgd	protein_coding	Dubious open reading frame; unlikely to encode a functional protein, based on available experimental and comparative sequence data [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004859]	R64-1-1	759183	758563	XIII	1	YMR245W
